  - 'Oliver finally stepped back through the ancient door, ready to return to his
    mother''s waiting arms. '
  - As he emerged from the forest, he expected to find Mrs. Jenkins anxiously awaiting
    his return, but to his surprise, he saw her standing nearby, a peaceful smile
    on her face.
  - Confusion and relief washed over Oliver. Had he been gone for days, weeks, or
    even longer? But as he approached his mother, she held out her arms and enfolded
    him in a warm embrace.
  - '"Oh, my dear Oliver," she whispered, her voice tinged with both joy and relief.
    "You''ve only been gone for a few minutes. I was beginning to worry, but now
    here you are, safe and sound."'
  - How could his grand adventure, which felt like a lifetime, have only lasted a
    few minutes?
  - The mystery of it all gnawed at Oliver's thoughts, leaving him with a lingering
    sense of wonder.
